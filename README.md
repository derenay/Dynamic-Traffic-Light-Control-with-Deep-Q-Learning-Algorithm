# Dynamic-Traffic-Light-Control-with-Deep-Q-Learning-Algorithm

The project's objective is to harness and implement machine learning methods for better traffic flow control at crossroads that depend on traffic light systems. Considering that experimentation with real roads and traffic lights involves legal and practical inoperability, a reasonable simulation of actual traffic scenarios was created for this project. This environment would be interfaced with live camera feeds and advance image processing for real-time data collection and interaction with the AI model. The model follows reinforcement learning by considering the density of the traffic and modifies the light sequence accordingly. The main purpose is to minimize waiting times and optimize the flow of vehicles at every juncture.
